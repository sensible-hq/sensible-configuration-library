  "description": "Residential Property Listing Sheets - A type of real estate document used by brokers and agents to present detailed information about a residential property that is listed for sale. These documents are typically generated from a Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and include property specifications, pricing, tax data, interior and exterior features, room descriptions, and photos. They often begin with the property's address, listing price, and basic details (e.g., MLS ID, property type, and status), and end with agent contact information, private remarks, and showing instructions."
